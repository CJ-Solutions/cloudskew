## Available features :heavy_check_mark:

The following features are available in CloudSkew right now:

* Create a new diagram from a template (or simply a new empty diagram).
* Print a diagram and/or export it to `.png`, `.jpg` or `.bmp` formats.
* Lock an entire diagram or just individual symbols (locking make things read-only, preventing them from being edited or deleted).
* Adjust visual properties of any symbol via the `visual properties` window.
* Diagrams are auto-saved.
* Load icons/symbols from symbol palette onto diagram by single-clicking on it.
* Search for an icon by typing in the icon name (or a synonym or category) in the symbol search box.
* Undo & redo actions.
* Access frequent commands via context menu (cut, copy, paste, delete etc).
* Adjust z-index of any symbol on the diagram (via context menu).
* Zoom in & out of a diagram.

## Planned features :calendar:

In the near team, the following features are on the roadmap:

* View & adjust z-index of diagram symbols via a separate control.
* Import custom icons into a diagram.
* Group multiple symbols together.
* Save checkpoints/snapshots (along with ability to restore-from/rollback-to a previous checkpoint).  
* Keyboard shortcuts for commonly performed actions.
* Display a symbol's contextual information via tooltips and/or thumbs.
* More icons, shapes and diagram templates. You can always request specific ones [here](https://github.com/cloudskew/cloudskew/issues/new/choose). You can view existing open requests [here](https://github.com/cloudskew/cloudskew/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aicon-request).

The relative priorities of these planned features will depend on the volume of user requests received. If you have a feature request that's not listed up here, you can file a new one [here](https://github.com/cloudskew/cloudskew/issues/new/choose).

New feature announcements will be listed on this [release page](https://github.com/cloudskew/cloudskew/releases).

## Found a bug? :beetle:

Please report it [here](https://github.com/cloudskew/cloudskew/issues/new/choose).

## Pricing :dollar:

CloudSkew will remain free for individual users. There are plans to add premium features for teams & enterprises in the future.

## Frequently asked questions :grey_question:

**Why can't the diagram canvas be resized?**

The diagram size is restricted to 900px x 500px (landscape mode). While it's possible to zoom in/out, it's not possible to change a diagram's height, width & orientation.

Custom diagram sizes might be enabled at a future point as a premium/paid feature.

**Any plans to auto-generate diagrams from existing infrastructure?**

Not in the [near-term future](#planned-features-calendar).

**Is this an open source project?**

No. However, would love to open source parts of it in the future to invite community contributions around:

* icons from different cloud providers.
* templates for some frequently created diagrams.

However not there yet, lot of features have to be added before all this can be enabled.
