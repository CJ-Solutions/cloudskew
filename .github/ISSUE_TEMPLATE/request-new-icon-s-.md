**What icon (or icon set) would you like to be included in cloudskew?**
Some examples:
* I'd like the Office365 icon set (word, powerpoint, excel etc) to be included.
* Would like the CNCF icons (kubernetes, prometheus etc) to be included. 

**Which area/domain would these icons fall under?**
E.g. IOT, databases, networks, serverless, monitoring etc. 

**Where can these icons be downloaded from?** (note: only `.svg` format is supported at the moment)
Would be great if you could point us to a download link for these icons. 

**Additional details**
